# Week of 08/30/2023 Progress Report
## Reflections
This week was the first week I had ever used Rhino. I came into it thinking it would be similar to other CAD software I've used like Solidworks or Fusion but it was different enough to challenge me. I jumped right into picking apart the cell phone stand file with everything in it because I wanted to see the entire file and how everything fit in. This was a bit overwhelming but I began to pick up on how Rhino and Grasshopper worked. 

I learned a lot about the visual coding system of grasshopper, and while I don't completely understand all of the functions within the file, I understand how things need to connect and how the use of sliders can allow for this became a generative design tool. I was able to use the sliders to generate the visuals of a stand that I wanted to use. I measured my own phone in order to do this, but I got stuck when trying to export the drawings to something that I could use on the laser cutter. I would be able to export the files by selecting them and then using the export command, but often the scale of my parts would be incorrect. Eventually I had to manually resize the bounding box in order to resize the parts correctly. 
The biggest thing I started to learn this week was how parametric modeling could be done in Rhino. The tutorial from TJ helped a lot, but only after I spent about 2 hours parsing through the visual code did I really begin to understand what happened in the file. I do not enjoy learning code like this, but it helped me play around and break the file so that I did understand some of the functions of the files. 

Once I had the file, taking it to laser cut was not much of an issue. As I have lots of experience with laser cutting, the ones in the Makerspace were not too bad. I was able to make a few test cuts with the default settings for plywood, and after a few adjustments my pieces cut out from the scrap perfectly and fit together very well. 

Overall, I think this was definitely more challenging than I had imagined, and I know I have a long way to go to understand something this complex but I have gotten a lot of knowledge from this so far. I think I will need to have more instruction to become better at Rhino and Grasshopper. I was able to laser cut a model of the phone stand with some modifications for my phone, and it seemed to work pretty well and fit my phone correctly. 

# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###

# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

or, if you prefer, you can create separate files and link to them here, like so:

---
[Example Report 1](weekly-reports/example-report-1.md)

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
